Hi, I'm Renato Pijanowski !

Currently searching for a new oportunity as developer. I worked before in backend as trainee.
Since mid 2019 I started to move more into development with Python, writing scripts to automate routines. I'm trying to acquire more experience, studying and
practicing every single day.

What I'm focusing on this moment:

Improving my SQL skills, Python and front-end (HTML, CSS and starting with JavaScript). I'm looking forward to work with datascience, machine learning and other
stuff as soon as possible.
